Chords is an application based on Web Serial connection, you can connect boards like Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano after uploading the ArduinoFirmware.ino code to it, you'll recieve data signals from the board which can be visualized on web using Chords. Users can visualize ECG and EMG signals.

## Features

- **Connection**: Experience a smooth connection/disconnection with board in single click.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Visualize incoming data without any jitter from the board in real-time on SmoothieCharts.
- **Recording**: Record the signals data and download data in csv file.

## How to use

1.  Connect the Arduino to your computer using a USB cable.
2.  Open the Arduino IDE and flash the provided firmware onto the Arduino.
